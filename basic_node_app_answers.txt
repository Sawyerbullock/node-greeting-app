What is a Node module?
A: A Node module is basically the same as a JavaScript library.
   They contain functions you want to use in your application.

What is the main difference between `exports` and `module.exports`?
A: `module.exports` is the code that can be used outside of the
   module by using `require()`. It can be overwrote to be anything.
   `exports` is only a reference to `module.exports` and any reassignment
   can not be accessed outside the module.

Why is using `exports` recommended?
A: Because this assures that you aren't messing with what is actually
   being imported using `require()`.
